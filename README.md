Solutions for exercises from the Rosalind platform for learning bioinformatics. My profile is here:
https://rosalind.info/users/codeforkjeff/

I work alongside bioinformatics engineers, so this is a hobby project to learn a bit more about
their field and about genomics in general. The solutions are written in Java, as I've been away from
that language for a few years and I miss working with it.

## Running the code

Open this repository as a project in IntelliJ. You can run individual problems in IntelliJ by opening
the appropriate .java file and clicking "Run" in its context menu.

You can also build a jar by running "mvn package" and running problems on the command line:

```
# replace PROBLEM_ID with a code like GC, FIB, etc.
java -jar target/rosalind-solutions-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar PROBLEM_ID
```
